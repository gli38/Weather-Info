# Weather-Info
Developed a script to use Open Meteo API to obtain weather information such as temperature and UV index and text users the information using Twilio API. For future updates, I want to implement conditions on finding the time or hour of the day when the UV index is high and notify the user to put on sunscreen during those hours.
